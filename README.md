## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```css
main {
  background: url(./images/pattern-background-mobile.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: contain;
}
```

### Continued development

Realized I've been focusing on only building projects with flexbox, so for the next project I'll try using grid layout.

### Useful resources

- [Full Size Background](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14059429/css-full-size-background-image) - This helped me to adjust the background image.
